Hi there, thanks for the issue!

This project is being maintained, but it's in a place where most people
should consider trying to fix their own problems instead of hoping 
for a maintainer to handle it. It works as-is for most of our use cases.

The [getting_started.md](./getting_started.md) guide shows how you can get 
a reproduction of your bug in a test really quickly, and the maintainers 
can help figure out how to go from red to green if you can't get it.
